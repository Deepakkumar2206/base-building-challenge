# Day 2 - Frontend with OnchainKit

## Project Title

**Base Frontend Day 2 - Wallet Connected Frontend with OnchainKit**

---

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Base Building Challenge.
The goal of Day 2 is to build a responsive frontend using **OnchainKit** that connects to the Base blockchain network.
It demonstrates how to scaffold a frontend with wallet connectivity, read and write data from a smart contract, and display wallet details such as balance and address.

---

## Task Summary

* Scaffold a frontend using **create-onchain**.
* Integrate wallet connection functionality using **wagmi** and **OnchainKit**.
* Interact with the **Greeter contract** deployed on Base Sepolia testnet.
* Display wallet information and allow users to send transactions.
* Run the application locally on **localhost:3000** for testing.

---

## Pre-installation Requirements

Ensure the following tools are installed before starting:

* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* npm or yarn
* Foundry (for contract deployment and verification)
* Git
* A Base Sepolia test wallet with test ETH

---

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deepakkumar2206/base-building-challenge.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd base-building-challenge/Day2/my-onchainkit-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open the app in your browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Foundry Commands Used

Although this day focuses on frontend development, Foundry was used in **Day 1** for contract setup and deployment.
Here are the key Foundry commands relevant to this project:

```bash
forge build
forge test
forge script script/DeployGreeter.s.sol --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

* `forge build`: Compiles the smart contract.
* `forge test`: Runs all test cases.
* `forge script`: Deploys the contract to Base Sepolia using your private key and RPC URL.

---

## Environment Configuration (.env)

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following content:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://base-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your_api_key
```

### Explanation:

* **NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID**: Unique identifier generated by OnchainKit Cloud. Used to connect your frontend app to the OnchainKit system.
* **NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL**: RPC endpoint provided by Alchemy or another node provider to communicate with the Base Sepolia network.

These environment variables are securely stored and accessed during app runtime without exposing sensitive credentials.

---

## OnchainKit Cloud Setup

1. Visit the OnchainKit Cloud Dashboard.
2. Create a new project under your account.
3. Copy the **Project ID** and **API URL** generated.
4. Paste them into your `.env` file as shown above.

This setup ensures that your frontend communicates securely with the Base blockchain via OnchainKit.

## Explanation of Important Files

### app/layout.tsx

Defines the global structure of the application.
Includes metadata, imported fonts, and wraps all pages using the RootProvider for context management.

### app/page.tsx

Serves as the main UI page.
Renders wallet connection components, displays contract data, and allows user interaction.

### app/rootProvider.tsx

Initializes and provides context using OnchainKit and wagmi.
Ensures that wallet connection and blockchain states are accessible throughout the app.

### src/contracts/Greeter.ts

Contains the contract address and ABI of the deployed **Greeter** smart contract on Base Sepolia.
Used for interacting with the blockchain.

### src/hooks/useGreeter.ts

Implements the logic for reading and writing data to the Greeter contract.
Uses wagmi hooks to manage transactions and contract calls.

### .env

Stores sensitive information like the RPC URL and project ID, ensuring they are not hardcoded into the source files.

---

## Deployment

Run the application locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After the server starts, open the following in your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

The frontend will connect to your wallet and interact with the deployed contract.

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Setting up a Next.js frontend with **create-onchain**
* Configuring **OnchainKit** and **wagmi** for wallet connectivity
* Interacting with smart contracts using React hooks
* Handling environment variables for security
* Implementing modular code structure for scalability

---

## Summary

Day 2 of the Base Building Challenge focuses on frontend development using OnchainKit and Base.
The task successfully integrates wallet connectivity, contract interaction, and UI design in a single application.
This serves as a foundation for creating decentralized applications that are both user-friendly and blockchain-connected.
